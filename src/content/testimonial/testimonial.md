“The **brilliant** and **diligent** engineers of Sandbox are,
without exaggeration, **indispensable** to my research. I came to
them with a challenging problem, and they delivered a solution that is
**twice as professional** as I'd hoped, in **half the time** I'd
expected. To any scientists in need of computational expertise:
**look no further than Sandbox.**”
