We’re building a diverse and skilled team of developers with a variety of experiences, interests, and backgrounds to come make some amazing software with us. As a developer, you’ll join a small Agile team and work on a practical software project that will make a significant impact on the work of researchers. Potential projects include web/mobile apps, web scrapers, data processing, and data visualization for professors and PhD students at Northeastern, Yale, and other universities. 

You’ll be part of a rapidly growing club with a wealth of leadership and project management opportunities. You’ll also learn and grow with our community of talented and motivated members, in addition to building connections with the research community at Northeastern.
