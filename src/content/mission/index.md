# Empowerment

We're ready to get serious with this. Just let it work around and play. Everybody should paint what they see and what they feel.

# Passion

Anyone can paint! If there's a secret to anything, it's practice. If you over-mix it, you just get one dead color.

# Inclusion

Drop in a fantastic, big ol' mountain. This is the lazy man's way of painting. Wherever you think they should be, then that's exactly where they should be.
