Sandbox is Northeastern’s student led software consultancy and aims to unleash the power of software for researchers and students. Our clients are scientists in a wide range of disciplines, and we engineer solutions to accelerate their research. We also develop in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as searchneu.com and GraduateNU (a tool to help students build a plan of study).

We're looking for designers to build our brand and design stunning user experiences for our projects. On our brand team, you'll work with our Head of Brand to create materials across our website, social media, apparel, and posters, as well as guide the direction of our brand. On our UX team, you'll work with our Head of UX and our development teams to craft excellent user experiences in the software applications that we build.

You’ll be part of a rapidly growing student organization with an opportunity to leave a significant and lasting impact. We welcome you to apply for the brand team, UX team, or both.
