Sandbox is Northeastern’s student led software consultancy and aims to unleash the power of software for researchers and students. Our clients are scientists in a wide range of disciplines, and we engineer solutions to accelerate their research. We also develop in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as searchneu.com and GraduateNU (a tool to help students build a plan of study).

We’re building a diverse and skilled team of developers with a variety of experiences, interests, and backgrounds to come make some amazing software with us.

You’ll be part of a rapidly growing student organization with a wealth of leadership and project management opportunities. You’ll also learn and grow with our community of talented and motivated members, in addition to building connections with the research community at Northeastern.
