quote: "Sandbox has utterly changed me as a programmer. I am confident, cooperative, and efficient, and have learned more in my first semester here than I ever thought possible from a student organization. I've built things I couldn't have even understood eight months ago, and made lasting friendships along the way."

Sandbox is a Northeastern’s student-led software consultancy and aims to unleash the power of student driven software. Not only do we engineer solutions to accelerate our clients' research but also do we develop in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as [searchneu.com](https://searchneu.com) and [GraduateNU](https://graduatenu.com).

You’ll be part of a rapidly growing student organization with a wealth of leadership and project management opportunities. You’ll also learn and grow with our community of talented and motivated members, in addition to building connections with the research community at Northeastern.

There will be two rounds for the interview. Each round will be divided into three tracks: a fundies track, an Algo track, and a Webdev track. Although these tracks are ordered by difficulty, we will match you to the right challenge ability in order for you to best showcase your by skill set. However, no matter which coding challenge you receive, we will treat them the same :D

Nevertheless, it is likely that you would use other resources to assist you to finish your challenges. But that's okay! We hope you will learn and have fun during the learning process :)
