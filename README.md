  Sandbox at Northeastern
</h1>

Hi! We're __Sandbox__, a club at Northeastern University 🐾 in Boston that focusing on enabling researchers and other nonprofits to more efficiently do the things they already do by building them custom software to help wiht their experiments.

This is our outward-facing website, designed and built using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) by the Sandbox team. If you are interested in what we do, please reach out to us at info@sandboxneu.com, or fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/aZB5fGMEBKB4uDLU7) if you'd like to develop with us in the fall.
