  Sandbox at Northeastern
</h1>

Hi! We're __Sandbox__, a student organization at Northeastern University 🐾 in Boston. We enable researchers and other nonprofits to more efficiently do the wonderful things they already do by building them custom software to help with their experiments and other ventures.

This is our outward-facing website, designed and built with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) by the Sandbox team. If you are interested in what we do, please reach out to us at info@sandboxneu.com, or fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/aZB5fGMEBKB4uDLU7) if you'd like to develop with us in the spring.
